## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Password Generation
1. Open the application
2. Configure your password requirements:
   - Set desired length (4-128 characters)
   - Select character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
   - Choose advanced options (exclude similar characters, add custom characters)
3. Click "Generate Password"
4. Copy, save, or analyze your password

### Batch Generation
1. Switch to the "Batch Generator" tab
2. Set the number of passwords to generate
3. Configure generation options (uses same settings as single generator)
4. Click "Generate Multiple Passwords"
5. Export results as needed

### Password Analysis
1. Go to the "Analyzer" tab
2. Enter a password to analyze
3. Click "Analyze" to get detailed strength report
4. Review recommendations for improvement

### Settings & Customization
1. Visit the "Settings" tab
2. Configure auto-copy, history saving, and security options
3. Save your preferences

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure


## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns for maintainability
- **Object-Oriented**: Clean class structure with inheritance
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation for better code quality
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling

### Security Implementation
- **Cryptographically Secure**: Uses `secrets` module for randomization
- **Entropy-Based Analysis**: Mathematical approach to strength calculation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced regex patterns for common weaknesses
- **No Data Persistence**: Sensitive data cleared from memory

### Performance
- **Efficient Generation**: Optimized algorithms for fast password creation
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large quantities without performance degradation
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection
- **Responsive UI**: Non-blocking operations with progress indicators

## üìä Password Strength Scoring

The application uses a comprehensive 100-point scoring system:

| Component | Max Points | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Length | 30 | Longer passwords are exponentially stronger |
| Character Diversity | 25 | Using multiple character sets |
| Entropy | 25 | Mathematical measure of randomness |
| Uniqueness | 10 | Ratio of unique to total characters |
| Pattern Penalties | -40 | Deductions for predictable patterns |
| Common Password | -40 | Major penalty for dictionary words |

### Strength Levels
- **Very Strong (90-100)**: Excellent security, very difficult to crack
- **Strong (75-89)**: Good security for most purposes
- **Good (60-74)**: Adequate for standard accounts
- **Fair (40-59)**: Minimum acceptable strength
- **Weak (20-39)**: Should be improved
- **Very Weak (0-19)**: Not recommended for use

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

### Test Coverage
- Core password generation functions
- Security analysis algorithms
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Performance benchmarks

## üîí Security Considerations

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Secure Random Generation**: Uses cryptographically secure randomness
- **Memory Safety**: Sensitive data cleared after use
- **No Network Communications**: Completely offline operation
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduces attack surface

### Recommendations for Users
- **Use Unique Passwords**: Never reuse passwords across accounts
- **Enable 2FA**: Two-factor authentication adds extra security
- **Regular Updates**: Change passwords periodically
- **Secure Storage**: Use a password manager for storage
